Additions:  LL(1) Parse Machine.  Utilizes character stream as a queue and LLStack as a stack.  Will successfully parse the information and generate a parse tree.  It will also let you know if there is an error in the grammar.

Issues: Order of tree print is incorrect. No PST-to-AST conversion included, nor symbol table.

Compiling and Running: Compiled and Tested with c++11. In terminal, the proper command is as follows:
                       g++ -std=c++11 parser.cpp

Files Included:
	parser.cpp
  	stream.txt
 	a.out -included for convenience
  	README.txt
	A3Example1-Output.txt
	A3Example2-Output.txt
	A3Example3-Output.txt
